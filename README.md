# Capstone---WPF
WPF version of Capstone

The Capstone Application repository uses a Windows Form for the program, which I initially chose because I believed it would make cross-platform development easier, but found it comes with some severe restrictions. As a result the program will be ported to WPF here. The transfer will allow for better UI design, and with it some better-designed backend code. This is NOT to be considered a replacement for the Capstone Application repository until that one says "deprecated."
